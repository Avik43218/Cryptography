# Cryptography

This Repository is dedicated towards the implementation of Cryptographic Encoding & Cryptography Algorithms respectively. 

---

## Algorithms & Encoding Schemes Currently Implemented 

### 1. Fixed XOR Encoding

- This code performs a bitwise XOR on two hexadecimal strings by converting them to binary, applying XOR on each bit, splitting the result into 4-bit chunks, and attempting to map them back to hex.
- It includes functions for hex-to-binary conversion, XOR logic, and chunking binary strings.

### 2. Hexadecimal to Base64 Encoding
